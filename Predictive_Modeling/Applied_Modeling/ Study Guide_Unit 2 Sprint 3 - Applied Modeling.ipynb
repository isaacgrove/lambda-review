There are a mix of written questions and coding exercises, both are equally important to prepare you for the sprint challenge as well as to be able to speak on these topics comfortably in interviews and on the job.\n","\n","If you get stuck or are unsure of something remember the 20 minute rule. If that doesn't help, then research a solution with google and stackoverflow. Only once you have exausted these methods should you turn to your Team Lead - they won't be there on your SC or during an interview.

It's very easy to hide incomplete knowledge and understanding behind fancy or technical words, so imagine you are explaining these things to a non-technical interviewer.\n","\n","1. What is a Catagorical Feature\n","```\n","Put your answer here\n","```\n","\n","2. What are Confusion Matrix?\n","```\n","--2x2 or 3x3 matrix that grids off true and predicted values\n","--true +, true -, false +, false -\n","--true values must be known\n","```\n","\n","3. What is Permutation Importances?\n","```\n","--importance is how much the score drops when a feature is unavailable\n","--for permutation importance, use just test set and shuffle the feature so it's just noise\n","--you need the feature to exist for the estimator to work\n","```\n","\n","4. What is feature isolation?\n","```\n","Put your answer here\n","```\n","\n","5. What is features interaction?\n","```\n","--When features depend on each other.\n","--you can no longer just sum up the feature effects\n","--imagine getting rid of 1 of the 2 interacting features. The other feature loses its information\n","```\n","\n","6. What is Shapley Values?\n","```\n","--it's a game theory concept. If players cooperate in a positive sum game and create a surplus, how do you distribute the surplus?\n","--how important was each player, and what payoff can they expect? The Shapley value provides one possible answer to this question.\n","--it works on an individual prediction basis, how much each feature impacts that prediction\n","```\n","\n","7. How do you get ROC AUC score??\n","```\n","--in a binary classifier, you set a threshold for how \"easy\" it is to classify something as True. You then plot True positive rate against False positive rate\n","--i.e. if you have a really high threshold of 1, everything gets classified as Postive. You get all the true positives, but incorrectly classify all the negatives as positive as well.\n","--Area under the curve in the chart is how well you did. You want to capture all the true positives without accidentally capturing false positives.\n","--0 to 1, 1 is best.\n","```\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dUQaIwbceohq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Practice Problems Choose a dataset of your own to fill this out."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gzQyr1iPfJBH","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Preprocessing\n","You may choose which features you want to use, and whether/how you will preprocess them."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"e5hj6Jjwen3J","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rq6bizULj6YF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Fit a model with the train set.
